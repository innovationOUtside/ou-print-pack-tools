# ou-print-pack-tools

Tools to support production of OU print packs from Jupyter notebooks, quarto files, etc.

Support currently exists for:

- generating OU branded PDF documents (one per notebook directory);
- generating epub books (one per notebook directory).

The intention is that the package can also be used as part of a Github Action automation script to generate print pack assets directly from content committed to a Github repository.
